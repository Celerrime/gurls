# Simple AppleScript to get URLs of tabs on browser

Tested on Safari and Chrome.

When working on a project, I often have multiple browser tabs open with information relating to that project. I wanted a way to simply save and open those tab URLs whenever I'm switching to-and-from project contexts. 

## Example #1
\# Get front window browser URLs and save to file 'urls' in working directory.
`$ gurls > urls`

\# Comes with bash script to open urls
`$ go < urls`
